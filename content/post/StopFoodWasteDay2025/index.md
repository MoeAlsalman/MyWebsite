## Overview

Eat like Gandhi. Yes, Mahatma Gandhi. He once said: “There are people in the world so hungry that God cannot appear to them except in the form of bread,” and “Be the change you are trying to create.” Thinking of our bread, the food we consume daily, do we cherish it? Did you know that 30 to 40 percent of the food supply in the United States goes to waste? We appreciate the food we are given through conserving it . One way to start reducing food waste is through Stop Food Waste Day. This globally recognized day is your first step in the thousand-mile journey of eating like Ghandi, appreciating food, and feeling gratitude for the blessing we are given; food. Why is this day important? Let’s uncover that.

## Food  Waste

Food waste is not only a national challenge but a global problem affecting us all. According to the World Health Organization, “1 in 11 people worldwide faced hunger in 2023.”  This elevated percentage is an active alarm that we must stop wasting food and help those who need it. Food waste outcomes are adverse and not limited to world hunger; those outcomes can manifest environmentally, too. Food waste is one of the most significant contributors to the rising rate of greenhouse gas emissions , Which holds the sun's heat, which in turn amplifies global warming.  By preserving food, we also protect the environment, ensuring we live on a thriving planet.

## Stop Food Waste Day

Stop Food Waste Day is a globally recognized event held annually on April 30th. It aims to raise global awareness about food waste and, most importantly, what we can do as individuals in our everyday lives to help reduce it. Stop Food Waste Day is a reminder that food conservation is not something we must dedicate a specific time or place to do; it is as simple as a lifestyle we can integrate into our routine. This great day was founded in 2017 by Compass Group USA, Inc., marking this year as the annual 9th Stop Food Waste Day. The movement was initially created to bring attention to the challenge of food waste that the world is facing. Yet, it has become a movement where we collectively face this challenge by honoring food and its value. Knowing that change ignites from inside, especially in communities, Having an international day that motivates food waste reduction is an excellent move towards building a collaborative bond between people worldwide to work together for a more sustainable food system.  This structure of societal engagement fosters education about the difficulties we face in food systems. By incorporating education, we will nourish the success of this campaign, as education is a leading factor that influences our behavior, simultaneously creating a difference in the long and short term. 

## How to get involved

Now, how can you be part of the Stop Food Waste Day? It is very easy, and there are various ways to contribute:

### 1. Utilizing leftovers

One way would be to utilize food leftovers instead of throwing them away. You would be surprised by what you can make using leftovers. A great resource to help with this is the recipes provided on the movement's official website. You can be as creative as you want; making delicious snacks or even meals from food that would have gone to waste is fun. A free cookbook is also available on the movement's official website.

### 2. Plan ahead

Planning before purchasing food items is a great way to minimize food waste. Make a grocery list before heading to the supermarket. By doing so, you will buy what you need for said recipe without the need to purchase extra items that would have gone to waste. This will help you financially, too, as it helps you navigate your grocery monthly budget, reduce unnecessary purchases, and clearly understand what your spending trends look like when it comes to food.

### 3. Post, Hashtag, Share!

Today, I pledge to reduce my food waste. Will you join me? Posting the Stop Food Waste Day pledge on social media is a great way to participate. You can also download the campaign toolkit from the official movement website. This toolkit includes downloadable social media cards that can be posted on Instagram and other platforms. You can download the cards, use the #StopFoodWasteDay hashtag, and post. By these simple steps, you have helped spread awareness. The kit has many informative printables that you can print and hang in your kitchen to help you conserve food when preparing food.

These are just a few ways to be a part of the movement. Remember that you can always contribute creatively in your own unique way. The sky is your limit.
